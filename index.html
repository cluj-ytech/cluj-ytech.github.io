    <h1 class="sec01" style="font-size: 40px; text-align:center; color:#222222">Well, hello there!</h1>
    <p style="text-align:center;">We are a group of IT students from different Universities in Cluj and we believe in learning. We also believe in holacracy which means we feel responsible for our own trajectory so for that we study and practice software development in school plus on our own free time. 
We are and always will be the kind of people who put their brainand hearts into the projects they're developing. What we’ve learned so far is mainly that Cluj is a hub where we can make some magic, together.</p>
    <h1 class="sec02" style="font-size: 30px; text-align:center; color:#222222">About Us</h1>
    <p style="text-align:center;">Cluj Y.Tech was born  through the wish of one Computer Science student who wanted to learn, but didn’t know how to and what to begin with, and who wanted to network with experienced people in order to receive advice.

We want to create a community of Computer Science students and recent graduates who are looking to learn more about different technologies as well as to meet new and interesting professionals from different tech fields.
</p>
    <h1 class="sec03" style="font-size: 40px; text-align:center; color:#222222">Our Mission</h1>
    <p style="text-align:center;">We want to create an enabling environment for knowledge transfer between IT professionals and students and bring awareness about the power of coding in this era. As Robert C. Martin once said, “Civilization depends upon us in ways it doesn't yet understand, in ways we don’t yet understood”. We want to create stronger connections between students and encourage them to share their knowledge with the community in order to grow together and speed-up the process of learning. </p>
