  <meta name="description" content="We are a group of IT students from different Universities in Cluj and we believe in 
learning. We also believe in holacracy which means we feel responsible for our own 
trajectory so for that we study and practice software development in school plus on our own free time. 
We are and always will be the kind of people who put their 
brainand hearts into the projects they're developing. What we’ve learned so far is mainly that Cluj is a hub where we can make some magic, together.">

    <h1 class="sec01" style="font-size: 40px; text-align:center; color:#222222">Well, hello there!</h1>
    <p style="text-align:center;">We’re a group of young techies, studying in Cluj. We feel responsible for our own trajectory so for that we study and practice software development in school plus on our own free time. We belive that we should absorb all the knowledge we can from University, but that there is more knowledge, experience and ideas out there.  Cluj is a vibrant city and we should take advantage of being here! And for that, we think we can do more if we stand united! <br/>We envision this community to be open, and that means freedom and great responsibility for all of us who want to make this happen! We believe in the pay it forward principle as a foundation for any healthy group. We are also interested to try out freedom. We know that with freedom comes great responsibility and we think it takes a lot of maturity to take responsibility for anything we start or influence. We want to be there, to observe the world, to learn and to get involved! Instead of asking for permission, we’ll ask for guidance. We think it’s faster to fix something down the road than to start only after having a perfect plan.

    <h1 class="sec02" style="font-size: 40px; text-align:center; color:#222222">About Us</h1>
    <p style="text-align:center;">Cluj Y.Tech was born  through the wish of one Computer Science student who wanted to learn, but didn’t know how to and what to begin with, and who wanted to network with experienced people in order to receive advice. We envision this community to be open, and that means freedom and great responsibility for all of us who want to make this happen! We believe in the pay it forward principle as a foundation for any healthy group. We are also interested to try out freedom. We know that with freedom comes great responsibility and we think it takes a lot of maturity to take responsibility for anything we start or influence.

    <h1 class="sec03" style="font-size: 40px; text-align:center; color:#222222">Our Mission</h1>
    <p style="text-align:center;">We want to create an enabling environment for knowledge transfer between IT professionals and students and bring awareness about the power of coding in this era. We will do this by creating an active network between ourselves and opportunities for guidance from those that have already been down this road. Our vision is having a complex learning experience, including different learning styles & areas, starting with coding and going forward with all the glue that makes great code into great projects.
