Weâ€™re a group of young techies, studying in Cluj. Through our experience, we believe that we should absorb all the knowledge we can from University, but that there is more knowledge, experience and ideas out there. Cluj is a vibrant city and we should take advantage of being here! And for that, we think we can do more if we stand united!
